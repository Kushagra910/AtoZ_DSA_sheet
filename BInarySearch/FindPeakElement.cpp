// 162. Find Peak Element
// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

// brute force is Linear search TC = O(n) , SC = O(1)
// Optimised way is to apply binary search beacuse int the question we have to do searching and it exhibits sorted nature in some parts of array either increasing or decreasing

// TC = O(logN)
// SC =O(1)
